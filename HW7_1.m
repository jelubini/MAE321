%% Problem 1:
% An $$ 85 kg $$ mass is suspended by a spring of stiffness $$ 20 \times 103 \
% N/m $$ with a viscous damping constant of $$ 1200 Ns/m $$. The mass is
% initially at rest and in equilibrium. Calculate the steady-state
% displacement amplitude and phase if the mass is excited by a harmonic
% force of $$ 75 N $$ at $$ 3 Hz $$.
%
% Find: $$ x, \phi $$
